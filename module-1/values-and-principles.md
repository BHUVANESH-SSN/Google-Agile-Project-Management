## ✅ The 4 Agile Values

Agile teams **balance** both sides of each value, but **prioritize the left** over the right:

1. **Individuals and Interactions**  
   **over** Processes and Tools  
   → Prioritize communication, collaboration, and human creativity over formal tools or rigid systems.

2. **Working Software**  
   **over** Comprehensive Documentation  
   → Focus on delivering value early and continuously, not writing lengthy documentation unless truly necessary.

3. **Customer Collaboration**  
   **over** Contract Negotiation  
   → Engage the customer frequently to adapt to their needs rather than locking into static agreements.

4. **Responding to Change**  
   **over** Following a Plan  
   → Plans are important, but flexibility to adjust to change is critical for delivering real value.

## 📌 How These Values Apply

- **Individuals and Interactions**: Agile emphasizes real conversations over endless email threads or rigid workflows. Tools should help—not hinder—people.
  
- **Working Software (or Deliverables)**: The focus is on what actually works and delivers value (e.g., software, prototypes, drafts) rather than perfecting paperwork.

- **Customer Collaboration**: Agile encourages ongoing involvement from stakeholders so that feedback is immediate and actionable.

- **Responding to Change**: Agile recognizes that requirements evolve. Plans should guide, not constrain, decision-making.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Agile isn't just about speeding up delivery—it's about **building the right thing**, the **right way**, with **the right people**. These values empower teams to deliver high-quality outcomes while adapting to real-world change.

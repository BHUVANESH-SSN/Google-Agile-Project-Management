# Agile vs. Waterfall: Key Differences

Agile and Waterfall are two popular approaches to project management. This guide outlines the core differences between them across **requirements**, **documentation**, and **deliverables**.

---

## 1. Requirements

### Waterfall
- Requirements are defined **up front** in detailed documentation.
- Changes to requirements require **formal change management**, often involving a Change Control Board.
- Suitable when the final product is **clearly understood and stable** (e.g., regulatory projects).

### Agile
- Requirements are **dynamic and evolve** with feedback.
- Teams prioritize a **living backlog** of feature ideas and requirements.
- Frequent iterations allow for **quick adjustments** to changing needs.
- Reduces risk of building something the customer doesnâ€™t want.

---

## 2. Documentation

### Waterfall
- Emphasizes **extensive documentation** at every phase.
- Necessary due to **hand-offs between phases** and across teams.
- Includes large, formally approved project plans.

### Agile
- Documentation is **lightweight and just enough**.
- Focuses on **real-time communication** over paperwork.
- Documents are created **only as needed**, with the goal of helping the team move forward.

## 3. Deliverables

### Waterfall
- Deliverables are produced **at the end of the project**.
- Often results in a **big release** or launch event.
- Feedback from stakeholders typically comes **after completion**, increasing risk.

### Agile
- Delivers **working software or outputs frequently**, in small increments.
- Promotes **continuous delivery** and early user feedback.
- Encourages **frequent validation** and course correction.

## Summary Table

| Aspect        | Waterfall                               | Agile                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Requirements** | Fixed and defined upfront                | Evolving and prioritized iteratively    |
| **Documentation** | Formal and extensive                     | Minimal and just-in-time                |
| **Deliverables**  | Delivered at end                         | Delivered continuously in iterations    |

Agile is particularly effective in **uncertain or fast-changing environments**, while Waterfall works best when the outcome is well-defined from the start.

# 📜 Agile Manifesto: Values and Principles

Agile is a highly collaborative and adaptive approach to project management, especially useful for complex and fast-changing environments. The Agile Manifesto consists of **four core values** and **twelve guiding principles**, which together shape the mindset and behavior of high-performing Agile teams.

## 🌟 The Four Agile Values

Agile values prioritize **individuals**, **working solutions**, **customer collaboration**, and **responsiveness to change** over rigid structures and processes:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**  
   > People and communication are more important than the tools or systems they use.

2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**  
   > Delivering real, usable products is more valuable than exhaustive paperwork.

3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**  
   > Engaging directly with the customer is better than relying only on legal agreements.

4. **Responding to change over following a plan**  
   > Being flexible and adaptive is more effective than rigidly sticking to a predefined plan.

## 📌 The Twelve Agile Principles

These principles are the foundation of Agile practices and describe how to deliver value, collaborate, and adapt effectively:

### 🧭 1. Early and Continuous Delivery  
**"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."**  
Deliver value as early and often as possible to build trust and receive feedback.

### 🔄 2. Welcome Changing Requirements  
**"Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."**  
Agile teams embrace change at any stage to maximize impact and competitiveness.

### 🚚 3. Deliver Frequently  
**"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."**  
Short, frequent delivery cycles help gather feedback and adjust direction early.

### 🤝 4. Daily Collaboration  
**"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."**  
Close communication with stakeholders keeps work aligned with real-world needs.

### 💪 5. Build Around Motivated Individuals  
**"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."**  
Empowered teams perform better and feel more invested in project success.

### 🗣️ 6. Prefer Face-to-Face Conversation  
**"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."**  
Real-time communication, even virtually, reduces misunderstandings and speeds decision-making.

### 📊 7. Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress  
**"Working software is the primary measure of progress."**  
Value is shown through working deliverables, not just documents or percentage completion.

### ⚖️ 8. Promote Sustainable Development  
**"Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."**  
Steady, realistic workloads prevent burnout and improve long-term productivity.

### 🧱 9. Focus on Technical Excellence and Good Design  
**"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."**  
High-quality work enables teams to adapt and evolve quickly.

### ✂️ 10. Simplicity is Essential  
**"Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential."**  
Avoid unnecessary work and focus on features that truly matter.

### 🧠 11. Self-Organizing Teams Build the Best Solutions  
**"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."**  
Teams should define their own workflows and be trusted to manage their processes.

### 🔍 12. Reflect and Adjust Regularly  
**"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."**  
Continuous improvement through retrospectives ensures the team evolves and grows.

## ✅ Summary

The Agile Manifesto emphasizes:

- Delivering **value early and often**
- Encouraging **collaboration** and **adaptability**
- Building **motivated, self-organizing teams**
- Reflecting and improving through **continuous learning**

Together, these values and principles create a powerful framework for navigating complexity and driving success in any industry—not just software.

# 🌱 Agile in Action: Office Green & VUCA

## 🔁 Quick Recap: What is VUCA?

VUCA is a framework used to understand the environment around a project or business. It stands for:

- **V — Volatility:** Fast, unpredictable changes
- **U — Uncertainty:** Lack of predictability; future is unclear
- **C — Complexity:** Many interconnected variables and systems
- **A — Ambiguity:** Unclear causes and effects; multiple possible interpretations

---

## 🎯 Why VUCA Matters in Project Management

Before choosing a project management approach, it’s crucial to assess the project environment:

- If your project shows **high VUCA characteristics**, Agile is usually the best fit.
- **Agile doesn’t eliminate VUCA**—but it gives teams the tools and systems to **adapt and succeed** despite it.

# Popular Agile Methodologies: Kanban, XP, and Lean

Agile is an umbrella term that includes many specific methodologies. While Scrum is the most popular, there are several others that are widely used and highly effective. Below is an overview of three major Agile methodologies: **Kanban**, **Extreme Programming (XP)**, and **Lean**.

## Kanban

**Kanban** comes from the Japanese words "Kan" (sign) and "Ban" (board). It emphasizes visualizing work, limiting work-in-progress (WIP), and maintaining a continuous flow.

### Key Concepts:
- **Kanban Board**: Visualizes tasks using columns like *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.
- **WIP Limit**: Restricts the number of tasks in progress to prevent overloading the team.
- **Flow**: Focuses on efficiency by ensuring tasks move quickly from start to finish.
- **Self-Organization**: Teams decide their own WIP limits and are empowered to manage their pace.
- **Pull System**: New work is added only after completing current tasks, supporting sustainable progress.

## Extreme Programming (XP)

**Extreme Programming (XP)** is a methodology that originated in software development and takes best practices to extreme levels. It emphasizes technical excellence, adaptability, and frequent feedback.

### Core Activities:
1. **Designing**:
   - Focus on simplicity.
   - Start with a basic model to meet key requirements, then add features iteratively.

2. **Coding**:
   - Clear, concise code is essential.
   - Easy-to-read code improves collaboration and problem-solving.

3. **Testing**:
   - Emphasizes *test-first development*.
   - Frequent testing catches defects early and ensures customer requirements are met.

4. **Listening**:
   - Encourages collaboration with the customer.
   - Values feedback and adapts to changing needs.

### Key Practices:
- **Pair Programming**: Two developers work together on the same task.
- **Continuous Integration**: Code is merged and tested frequently throughout the day.
- **Refactoring**: Ongoing improvement of code without changing its functionality.
- **Avoid Big Design Up Front**: Start simple and evolve the design.
- **Write Tests, Not Requirements**: Use test cases as both requirements and validation.

## Lean

**Lean** comes from manufacturing and focuses on eliminating waste while maximizing value for the customer. It heavily influenced Agile.

### Lean's 5 Principles:
1. **Define Value**:
   - Identify what the customer values and involve them in the process.

2. **Map the Value Stream**:
   - Visualize all steps in the process and remove unnecessary steps (waste).

3. **Create Flow**:
   - Ensure work moves efficiently through the process.
   - Remove bottlenecks and delays.

4. **Establish Pull**:
   - Let customer demand drive the workflow.
   - Deliver value when and where it's needed.

5. **Pursue Perfection**:
   - Continuously improve the system and refine each of the above steps.

### Agile Connection:
- Agile adopted many ideas from Lean, including:
  - Focus on customer collaboration.
  - Emphasis on continuous improvement.
  - Empowered, self-organizing teams.

## Summary

| Methodology | Focus Area                       | Key Features |
|-------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Kanban      | Visual workflow, flow efficiency| WIP limits, Pull system, Continuous flow |
| XP          | Technical practices, quality    | Pair programming, Test-first, Continuous integration |
| Lean        | Value delivery, waste reduction | Define value, Value stream mapping, Flow, Pull, Perfection |

Each of these methodologies reflects Agile values and principles in unique ways. Teams often blend elements of multiple methodologies to suit their specific needs.

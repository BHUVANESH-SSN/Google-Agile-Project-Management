# History of Agile and Agile Manifesto

## Introduction

In earlier lessons, we explored **Agile** and **Waterfall** project management at a high level. This section goes deeper into:

- The history of Agile
- The meaning behind the Agile approach
- Agile values and principles
- How Agile is applied across industries

---

## Waterfall – Quick Review

**Waterfall** is a linear and sequential project management methodology.

- Each project phase is completed **one at a time** in a strict order.
- You move to the next phase **only after completing** the current one.
- The process flows **like a waterfall**, from the top down.

### Limitations:
- **Inflexible** once started
- Changes are **difficult** to implement mid-process
- Heavy focus on **planning and documentation**

---

## What is Agile?

The word **"agile"** literally means:
- The ability to **move quickly and easily**
- Being **flexible** and open to change

In project management, Agile means:
- **Iterative work cycles**
- Frequent repetition and adaptation
- A focus on **value delivery** over strict planning

---

## Agile Project Management

Agile Project Management is an approach guided by the **Agile Manifesto**, which defines:

- **4 Values**
- **12 Principles**

These promote a **mindset** focused on flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress.

Agile is:
- **Not a single methodology**
- A **philosophy** used across various frameworks (like Scrum, Kanban)

## Agile vs. Waterfall – At a Glance

| Feature         | Waterfall                   | Agile                           |
|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Structure       | Linear, Sequential           | Iterative, Flexible              |
| Phases          | Fixed and follow one another | Repeatable iterations            |
| Change Handling | Resistant to change          | Welcomes change anytime          |
| Feedback        | At end of project            | Continuous, during development   |
| Delivery        | Big release at end           | Small, frequent releases         |

## The Origins of Agile

- Agile methodologies **emerged in the 1990s**, during a **software boom**.
- Startups and tech giants needed to:
  - **Innovate faster**
  - Stay **competitive**
  - Deliver software **quickly and reliably**

This fast-moving industry needed new, **flexible processes**.

---

## The Agile Manifesto

In **2001**, a group of software leaders met in Utah to:

- Identify common values across their methods
- Solve a shared problem:  
  > “Teams were overly focused on planning and documentation, and lost sight of customer value.”

They created the **Agile Manifesto** to refocus development on:
- **People over processes**
- **Flexibility over rigidity**
- **Working solutions over exhaustive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**

The result became the **foundation** of Agile Project Management.

## Beyond Software – Agile Everywhere

Though Agile began in software, it is now used in many industries, including:

- **Healthcare**
- **Manufacturing**
- **Aerospace**
- **Finance**
- **Education**
- **Marketing**
- **Government projects**

Agile also incorporates concepts from **Lean Manufacturing**, especially from **Toyota’s production systems** in the 1930s.

---

## Summary

- **Waterfall** = Predictable, step-by-step, inflexible
- **Agile** = Adaptive, iterative, customer-focused
- Agile started in software, but is now used **everywhere**
- The **Agile Manifesto** (2001) defines the mindset behind Agile

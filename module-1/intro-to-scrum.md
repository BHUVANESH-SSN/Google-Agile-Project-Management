# Scrum Methodology

## What is Scrum?

- Scrum is **not** an acronym.
- The term comes from **rugby**, where players work closely as a unit to push forward—an analogy for close-knit, collaborative teams.
- Scrum is the most widely-used Agile framework, especially in **software** but also adaptable across industries.

## Key Characteristics of Scrum

- **Iterative and Incremental** delivery of work.
- Emphasizes **team collaboration**, **flexibility**, and **continuous improvement**.
- Work is delivered in **short cycles** called **Sprints**.
- Teams meet **daily** to discuss progress and resolve issues.

## Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog**:  
  A prioritized list of features, fixes, or tasks maintained and updated throughout the project.
  
- **Sprint**:  
  A time-boxed development cycle, usually **1–4 weeks** (commonly 2 weeks).
  
- **Daily Scrum (Stand-Up)**:  
  A short (≤15 minutes) daily meeting where the team reviews progress and addresses blockers.

## Scrum Roles

- **Scrum Master**:  
  - Ensures the team follows Agile values and Scrum practices.  
  - Shields the team from distractions.  
  - Acts as a facilitator and coach.

- **Product Owner**:  
  - Owns and prioritizes the **Product Backlog**.  
  - Maximizes product value.  
  - Represents the stakeholders' voice.

- **Development Team**:  
  - A cross-functional group that builds the product.  
  - Responsible for delivering working increments each Sprint.

## Why Scrum Is Popular

- Clear roles and responsibilities.
- Predictable schedules and ceremonies.
- Supports Agile values while offering structure.
- Free and open to use.
- Supported by a large ecosystem of tools, training, and certifications.

## Ideal Use Cases

- Cross-functional teams of **3–9 members** ("pizza-size teams").
- Projects that benefit from **iteration**, **feedback**, and **flexibility**.
- Environments that value **team learning**, **adaptability**, and **self-management**.

## Non-Software Use Cases

Although Scrum originated in software development, it is now used for:

- Event planning
- Personal productivity
- Education
- Product design
- Aerospace and robotics


# Founding Principles of Scrum

Scrum was first described in the context of Agile development in 1986 in the Harvard Business Review by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in their paper *The New New Product Development Game*. The term "Scrum" was inspired by the sport of rugby, where players work closely together to move the ball forward as a team.

The key idea behind Scrum is to form dynamic, self-organizing teams that can adapt quickly and collaborate effectively to achieve complex goals. The paper highlights several core characteristics of Scrum teams:

---

## 1. Built-in Instability

Teams are given challenging goals and freedom in how they achieve them. This deliberate instability creates a tension that drives creativity and innovation, encouraging teams to go beyond the ordinary.

---

## 2. Self-Organizing Teams

Scrum teams are designed to function like small startups. They have no rigid hierarchy and operate with autonomy, collaboration, and continuous self-improvement.

---

## 3. Overlapping Development Phases

Work within the team is not done in isolated silos. Instead, individual efforts begin to overlap, and over time, the team synchronizes its pace to meet shared goals and deadlines.

---

## 4. Multi-Learning

Scrum embraces learning by doing. Teams rely on trial and error, and members are expected to stay up-to-date with evolving market needs and quickly adapt to change.

---

## 5. Subtle Control

Even though teams are self-managed, control is not absent. Scrum uses structured checkpoints (like reviews and retrospectives) to maintain oversight without stifling creativity.

---

## 6. Organizational Transfer of Learning

Learning is not limited to the team. Scrum encourages members to share knowledge, pick up new skills, and support each other. This enables cross-functional collaboration and a broader distribution of expertise.

---

## Conclusion

Individually, these elements may not drive performance. But when combined, they create a powerful dynamic that fosters speed, flexibility, and innovation—core strengths that define modern Scrum teams.

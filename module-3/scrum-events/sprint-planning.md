# Sprint Planning: Setting Up the Sprint for Success

Welcome back!

In the last video, we discussed the **parameters of a Sprint**, one of the five Scrum events. A Sprint forms the **framework** around which all other Scrum events occur. Now, let’s dive into the **first event within the Sprint**—**Sprint Planning**.

## 🧭 What Is Sprint Planning?

**Sprint Planning** is the first event within the Sprint. It sets the team up for success by:
- Confirming **capacity** (time and availability of team members)
- Selecting the **Product Backlog Items (PBIs)** to be completed
- Establishing the **Sprint Backlog**
- Defining the **Sprint Goal**

---

## 👥 Who Attends?

The **entire Scrum Team** participates, including:
- **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the meeting
- **Product Owner** – Clarifies Backlog items and priorities
- **Development Team** – Estimates effort and commits to work

---

## 🔍 Key Questions to Answer During Sprint Planning

1. **Who is available this Sprint?**  
   Are there any planned vacations, absences, or conflicts?

2. **What is our average velocity?**  
   How many Story Points or PBIs have we completed in past Sprints?

3. **What can and should be accomplished this Sprint?**

4. **What is our Sprint Goal?**  
   Why are we building what we're building?

5. **How will the work be completed?**  
   Who is responsible for which tasks?

## ✅ Definition of Done (DoD)

The **Definition of Done** is an agreed-upon checklist that defines what it means for a Product Backlog Item (PBI) to be "done."

Typical elements of a DoD may include:
- Code or solution reviewed by an independent peer group
- All required tests passed (e.g., unit, performance, security)
- Required documentation is completed
- All acceptance criteria defined by the Product Owner are met
- Product Owner accepts the user story as complete

> 🔄 The Definition of Done can evolve as the team matures.

## 📦 What Is the Sprint Backlog?

The **Sprint Backlog** is a **subset** of the Product Backlog items the team commits to completing during the Sprint.

### Example:
Virtual Verde’s Product Backlog has 50 items.  
For the **May Sprint** (a 4-week Sprint), the team selects the **top 5 items** based on:
- Team capacity
- Effort required for each item

These 5 items now form the **Sprint Backlog** for May.

## 🎯 What Is the Sprint Goal?

The **Sprint Goal** is the overarching objective that ties the Sprint Backlog items together. It provides focus and a shared purpose.

### Example Sprint Goal:
> *Provide a comprehensive experience to users who want to install a bonsai tree in their home office.*

### Supporting Sprint Backlog Items:
- Users can purchase bonsai trees
- Access an online forum about home office decor
- Vendor team adds audit results for bonsai quality
- Users can use coupons for home office accessories
- Customer support links products to support tickets

Each item supports the bigger vision and contributes to the Sprint Goal.

## 🔁 Summary

Sprint Planning results in:
- A **well-defined and estimated Sprint Backlog**
- A **motivational Sprint Goal** that guides the team throughout the Sprint

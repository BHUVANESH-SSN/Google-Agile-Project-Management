# Sprint Retrospective in Scrum

If you've been following this program, you've learned a lot about **retrospectives**, an important part of project management—regardless of the approach you're taking.

In this section, we’ll cover the **last of the five events of Scrum**: the **Sprint Retrospective**.

---

## 🌀 What is a Sprint Retrospective?

- The **Sprint Retrospective** is an essential meeting (up to 3 hours) for the **Scrum Team**.
- It allows the team to **reflect**, **step back**, and identify **improvements** regarding how they work together.
- Focus areas:
  - People 👥
  - Processes ⚙️
  - Tools 🧰

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Discussed

- What **worked** or **didn’t work** during the last Sprint?
- What improvements were introduced last Sprint?
- Were they effective? If not, **why**?
- What should we try in the **next Sprint**?

## ✅ Tips for a Successful Retrospective

### 1. Create a **Blameless and Respectful** Environment
- Demonstrate the Scrum value of **respect**.
- Make the team feel **safe** to speak without fear of consequences.
- Encourage **candor** and open feedback.
- If needed, offer **anonymous** or **private** feedback channels.

### 2. Encourage Participation 🤝
- Retrospectives only work if team members believe their input matters.
- If participation is low, try prompting with questions:
  - *"What is one thing we could try in the next Sprint?"*
  - *"What slowed us down?"*
  - *"What happened that we didn’t expect?"*

### 3. Balance the Negative with the Positive ⚖️
- Don’t just focus on what to improve.
- Ask:
  - *"Where did we notice success?"*
- Reinforce the **positive** outcomes to **recreate** them in future Sprints.

### 4. Act on the Feedback 🛠️
- Ensure changes or improvements are made based on the team’s feedback.
- If no action is taken, team members may feel discouraged.
- Reinforce good practices and convert them into **team habits** and **norms**.

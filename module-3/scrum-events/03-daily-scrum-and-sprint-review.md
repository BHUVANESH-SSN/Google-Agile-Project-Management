# Face-to-Face Communication in Scrum: Daily Scrum & Sprint Review

As a refresher, one of the principles of the **Agile Manifesto** states:

> *"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a Development Team is face-to-face conversation."*

In this section, we'll explore two important face-to-face events that occur **during and after the Sprint**:
- **Daily Scrum** (also known as Stand-up)
- **Sprint Review**

---

## 🕒 Daily Scrum (Stand-up)

The **Daily Scrum** is a short, time-boxed meeting—**15 minutes or less**—held at the **same time and place every day**. Its purpose is to help the team **synchronize efforts**, **prioritize tasks**, and **reinforce focus** on the **Sprint Goal** and **Sprint Backlog**.

### 👤 Each team member answers three questions:
1. **What did I do yesterday** that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?
2. **What will I do today** to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
3. **Are there any impediments** preventing me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

### 🎯 Key Benefits:
- Quick identification and resolution of blockers by the **Scrum Master**
- Reinforces alignment and shared ownership
- Encourages focus on daily progress toward Sprint objectives

> 💡 While the **Scrum Guide** requires Daily Scrums to happen **every day**, some teams (like mine) meet less frequently—e.g., **twice a week**—and still see strong results. Experiment with what works best for your team.

## ✅ Sprint Review

The **Sprint Review** occurs at the **end of the Sprint**. It is a **collaborative working session** where the Scrum Team **demonstrates what was accomplished** and gathers feedback from stakeholders.

This event supports the Scrum pillars of:
- **Inspection**
- **Adaptation**

And reinforces the Scrum values of:
- **Openness**
- **Courage**
- **Respect**

### 🛠 What happens during a Sprint Review?
- The **Development Team** demonstrates completed work
- The **Product Owner** and team assess what is **"Done"**
- Stakeholders provide **immediate feedback**
- Future work is discussed, based on progress and feedback

### ⏱ Timebox:
- Maximum of **4 hours** for a **1-month Sprint**
- Shorter Sprints should have proportionally shorter Reviews

## 📧 Example: Sprint Review in Action

**Scenario**: Virtual Verde is launching a new website page for home office plants.

One Sprint Backlog item:  
➡️ *Create a launch email for existing corporate customers (Plant Pals).*

During the Sprint Review:
- The marketing specialist demos the email
- The team gives real-time feedback, such as:
  - "Love the opening line—it’s engaging!"
  - "Let’s make the image bigger."
  - "Can we simplify this text?"
  - "Can we add a 'Forward to a friend' option?"

### 💬 Benefits of this live review:
1. **Immediate feedback**—no waiting on async reviews
2. **Shared ownership**—everyone contributes to improving the product
3. **Cross-functional learning**—team members understand each other's work better

## 📦 What Is a Product Increment?

At the end of the Sprint, the team produces a **Product Increment**—the sum of all completed and potentially releasable work.

- **Only items meeting the Definition of Done** are included.
- Anything not completed returns to the **Product Backlog**.

### 🧪 What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
An MVP is a version of the product with **just enough features** to satisfy early customers and gather feedback.

> 🚀 The Product Increment should always be in a **releasable state**, even if the team chooses not to release it immediately.

---

## 🔁 Summary

- **Daily Scrum** keeps the team aligned and focused each day.
- **Sprint Review** allows inspection of the product and feedback from stakeholders.
- Both events promote **transparency**, **collaboration**, and **continuous improvement**.

# 🔄 Backlog Refinement in Scrum

Welcome back! We've been exploring everything there is to know about the **Product Backlog**. While the **Product Owner** owns the data in the Backlog, the **Scrum Team** must work together to keep this living document up to date.

---

## 🛠️ What is Backlog Refinement?

**Backlog Refinement** (also called **Backlog Grooming**) is the process of keeping the Backlog:
- Well-described
- Estimated
- Prioritized

This ensures the Scrum Team can operate effectively and plan with clarity.

---

## ✅ Key Elements of Backlog Refinement

During refinement, the Product Owner and the Scrum Team review the Backlog to ensure:

1. It contains appropriate and relevant items  
2. No unnecessary items remain  
3. The items are **prioritized** (also called setting the _order field_)  
4. Top items are **"ready for delivery"** with clear **acceptance criteria**  
5. All items have **estimates** for effort or complexity

---

## ⏳ Why Estimation Matters

Estimates help inform planning by assessing how much work is involved in completing each item.

> ❗ **Humans tend to underestimate** how long tasks take, which can lead to projects running late or over budget.

Instead of relying on **absolute estimation** (traditional project management: hours/days), Scrum uses **relative estimation** to compare tasks against each other.

## 📏 Relative Estimation Methods

### 1. 👕 T-Shirt Sizes

One of the simpler estimation techniques. Steps:
- Pick a **medium-sized** item in the Backlog
- Label it as **"Medium"**
- Compare other items to this anchor
- Assign sizes like **Small, Medium, Large, XL**

#### 📦 Example from Virtual Verde:
- **Medium** = Launch new logo  
- **Small** = Create new account page  
- **Large** = Add bonsai trees to catalog  
- **XL** = Create mobile app

---

### 2. 📊 Story Points (Fibonacci Sequence)

A more advanced and nuanced method.

#### 🔢 Common Sequence Used:
`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...`

- Start by selecting an **anchor item**
- Assign it a story point value (e.g., 5)
- Compare other items relative to this anchor
- Story points reflect **effort + risk**

> 📌 The higher the number, the **greater the uncertainty and complexity**.

### 🍉 Fun Estimation Exercise: Fruits 🍓🍍🍒

Estimate how much effort it takes to **completely consume** different fruits:

| Fruit     | Story Points | Reason                                                       |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mango     | 5            | Anchor item                                                  |
| Orange    | 3            | Easier to peel than a mango                                  |
| Strawberry| 1            | Low effort, minimal prep                                     |
| Banana    | 3            | Peeling required, but easy                                   |
| Pineapple | 13           | Huge, hard to prep, can't eat in one sitting                 |
| Cherry    | 2            | Seeds and stems, small effort                                |

This exercise shows how teams think differently about **effort and risk** and helps uncover potential issues early.

## 📌 T-Shirt Sizes vs. Story Points

**T-Shirt Sizes** are good for beginners but lack granularity.  
**Story Points** provide more accuracy.

### 🧪 Example:
| Task                         | T-Shirt Size | Story Points |
|------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Add new user page            | Medium       | 8             |
| Add bonsai trees to catalog  | Medium       | 13            |

👉 Though both were marked "Medium," story points reveal **significant differences** in effort and complexity.

## 🕒 When to Do Backlog Refinement

Teams can decide how and when to conduct refinement:
- As **dedicated meetings**
- **Continuously**, through ongoing conversations or emails
- As part of the **Sprint Planning Meeting**

---

## 🎯 Summary

You now know how to:
- ✅ Define **Backlog Refinement**
- ✅ Explain the importance of **estimation**
- ✅ Apply **T-shirt sizes** and **story points**
- ✅ Understand how estimation helps identify **risk and complexity**

Next up: **Sprint Planning**! 🚀  
See you there!

# 👕 T-Shirt Sizes and 🧮 Story Points in Agile Estimation

In Agile projects, **T-shirt sizes** and **story points** are the two most common units used to estimate user stories. Both are forms of **relative estimation**, where you compare the effort of one backlog item to another, rather than estimating exact time.

## 📏 Relative Estimation

**Relative estimation** means comparing the effort required to complete one backlog item against another. This approach is more accurate than time-based estimates and helps teams build a consistent frame of reference over time.

## 👕 T-Shirt Sizes

T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) may sound unusual at first, but it’s quick, intuitive, and great for teams new to Agile.

### ✅ Benefits:
- Quick and easy to use
- Widely understood
- Ideal for beginners in Agile estimation

### 🧭 Process:
1. **Agree on the scale and what each size represents**
2. **Choose an anchor item** (or two—one small, one large)
3. **Compare remaining backlog items** to the anchor(s)
4. **Assign T-shirt sizes** based on perceived effort

## 🧮 Story Points

Story points are a more advanced estimation technique, often used by experienced Agile teams. Teams typically use the **Fibonacci sequence** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...) to assign effort values.

### ✅ Benefits:
- Offers **more granularity and precision** than T-shirt sizes
- Helps distinguish between moderately and significantly larger tasks
- Reduces false accuracy in time-based planning

### 🧭 Process:
1. **Agree on the scale** (e.g., up to 21, or jump to 100 if needed)
2. **Choose an anchor item** and assign it a point value
3. **Estimate remaining items** relative to the anchor
4. **Record the estimates** in your backlog tool

## 💡 Best Practices (for Both Methods)

- ❓ **Ask clarifying questions** to the Product Owner to ensure the team fully understands the item.
- 💬 **Discuss divergent estimates**—different viewpoints can uncover hidden complexity or missing details.
- ✅ **Agree on the final estimate** and document it.
- 🔍 **Split large items**—if an item is too large (XL or 21+), consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Both **T-shirt sizes** and **story points** are effective methods for estimating user stories:

- 🟢 **Beginner teams**: Start with **T-shirt sizes** for simplicity.
- 🔵 **Experienced teams**: Use **story points** for greater precision.

> The most important thing is to **choose the method that works best for your team** and remain consistent.

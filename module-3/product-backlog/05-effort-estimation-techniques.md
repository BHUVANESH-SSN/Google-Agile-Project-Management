# ⚙️ Agile Effort Estimation Techniques

There are various techniques for estimating effort in an Agile environment. Effective **relative effort estimation** leads to predictable Sprint outcomes and overall project success. While the specific methods may vary, the general steps to Agile estimation are usually the same.

## 📋 Common Agile Estimation Techniques

### 1. 🃏 Planning Poker™

A widely used consensus-based technique for estimating small sets of items (typically <10).

- Team members use a **deck of cards** with Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.)
- Cards may also include:
  - **❓** for uncertainty or lack of understanding
  - **☕** for a break
- Used in **Sprint Planning** meetings
- Each member picks a card **face-down**, then reveals it simultaneously
- Discussion follows, especially if estimates vary widely
- Helps **avoid anchoring bias** and encourages independent thought

---

### 2. 🔴 Dot Voting

A simple technique for a small number of items.

- Each member gets **colored dot stickers** based on size:
  - Green = Small
  - Blue = Medium
  - Orange = Large
  - Red = Extra Large
- User stories are posted on a wall or table
- Team members place their dots on the corresponding items
- Quick visual method to identify consensus

---

### 3. 🪣 The Bucket System

Ideal for **large Backlogs**, even with **hundreds of items**.

- Place a series of numbered note cards (effort levels) in a line
- Each item/user story is randomly drawn and **placed into a "bucket"** (note card)
- No discussion is required unless there’s a challenge
- Max **2 minutes per item**
- Encourages **quick and scalable estimation**

---

### 4. ⚖️ Large / Uncertain / Small

A quick method of **rough estimation**.

- Categorize items into **only three groups**:
  - Large
  - Uncertain
  - Small
- Start with the easiest, most obvious items
- Discuss and categorize remaining items
- Great for teams with **similar or comparable tasks**

---

### 5. 🔢 Ordering Method

Good for **smaller teams** with **many items**.

- Place items randomly along a scale from **low to high**
- Each team member can move **one item one position** per turn, or pass
- Continue until no one wants to move items
- Results in a prioritized, effort-based list

---

### 6. 🧲 Affinity Mapping

Effective for teams with **20+ Product Backlog items**.

- Use sticky notes for each user story
- Place one item on the board to start
- Compare each new item to the existing ones and **group by similarity**
- After all are grouped (ideally 3–10 groups), assign each group a **theme**
- **Prioritize** the groups to determine order of execution

## ⭐ Characteristics of Effective Estimation Techniques

No matter the technique, effective estimation methods share several important traits:

### ✅ 1. Avoids False Precision
- Rough estimates are **more accurate** over time than falsely precise ones
- Helps avoid unnecessary debates like 7 vs. 10 days

### ✅ 2. Prevents Anchoring Bias
- Techniques like Planning Poker **keep estimates private initially**
- Encourages independent thinking before discussion

### ✅ 3. Promotes Inclusivity
- Everyone participates, fostering **team trust and cohesion**

### ✅ 4. Leads to Effort Discovery
- Dynamic discussions help surface **risks, strategies**, and **hidden challenges**

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

There are multiple strategies for estimating and prioritizing your Product Backlog. All of them are valuable. The best one is the **one your team feels most comfortable with**.

> Estimation is not just about numbers—it's about **clarity, collaboration, and continuous learning**.

## Understanding the Product Backlog in Scrum

In this program, we‚Äôve introduced several key project management artifacts‚Äîlike **project plans**, **statements of work (SOWs)**, and **RACI charts**. Now, we‚Äôll explore one of the most important artifacts of the **Scrum framework**: the **Product Backlog**.

### What Is the Product Backlog?

As defined earlier, the **Product Backlog** is the *single authoritative source* for the work a team is undertaking. It contains all features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables that help achieve the project‚Äôs goal. In traditional, non-Agile project management, the equivalent would be a set of **project requirements**.

### üîë Key Features of the Product Backlog

1. **Living Artifact**  
   - The Product Backlog evolves throughout the lifecycle of the project.
   - Items can be added at any time.
   - It guides the team on what to work on next.

2. **Owned by the Product Owner**  
   - Only the **Product Owner** has the authority to adjust and prioritize items in the backlog.

3. **Prioritized List**  
   - Items are listed in order of **importance**.
   - Items at the top are more detailed and well-defined than those lower on the list.

### üß∞ Product Backlog Best Practices

Each item in the Product Backlog should include the following:

- **Description**  
  Clearly define what the item is. Example:  
  > *As a Virtual Verde client, I want to grow my choice of vegetables while working from home in my NYC apartment.*

- **Value**  
  Indicates business or user value. For example:
  - `$` = Low value
  - `$$$$` = High value  
  This helps prioritize what delivers the most impact.

- **Estimate**  
  Represents the relative effort required by the **Development Team**.  
  (We‚Äôll cover **relative effort estimation** in detail later.)

- **Order**  
  Items are **stack-ranked** by priority. High-value, low-effort tasks should typically appear higher in the list.

### üìù Sample Scenario: Virtual Verde

Virtual Verde‚Äôs Product Backlog may look like this:

| Order | Item                    | Description                                                                                 | Value | Estimate |
|-------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|
| 1     | Succulents              | Easy-to-maintain plants preferred by remote workers.                                        | `$$$`  | Medium   |
| 2     | Orchids                 | More complex to care for but requested by multiple users.                                   | `$$`   | High     |
| 3     | Bonsai Trees            | Assumption: low demand and high maintenance. Needs further market validation.              | `$`    | High     |

üìå Note: Assumptions can be added to backlog items and revisited when those items move up the priority list.

### ü§ù Team Roles and the Backlog

- **Product Owner**:  
  - Owns and prioritizes the backlog  
  - Makes sure the backlog is visible and transparent to all stakeholders

- **Development Team**:  
  - Estimates the effort required for each backlog item  
  - Works from the backlog to build increments of the product

### üß≠ Summary

You now understand:
- What the **Product Backlog** is
- Who **owns** and manages it
- How to define **key fields**: description, value, estimate, and order
- Best practices to keep your backlog actionable and prioritized

In the **next video**, we‚Äôll explore **how to manage a Product Backlog** as it evolves during Scrum practices.

üëâ *Meet you there!*

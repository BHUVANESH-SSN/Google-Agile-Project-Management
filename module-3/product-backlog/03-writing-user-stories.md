# 🧾 Understanding User Stories in Scrum

In the last video, you learned about the **Product Backlog** and how to build it using factors like **descriptions**, **value**, **order**, and **estimations**. These elements help ensure the Product Owner's vision for **user value** is met.

## 📘 What Are User Stories?

User stories are **short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the user's perspective**. This helps the team design and build solutions centered on **user experience**.

> **Format:**  
> *"As a [user role], I want [action] so that [benefit]."*

User stories can be:
- Large and broad at first
- Broken down into smaller, more specific stories over time

## 👥 Creating Personas

When writing effective user stories, having a clear user in mind is key. A great technique is creating **personas**—fictional, detailed descriptions of your target users.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Sample Personas for Virtual Verde:
- **Leo**: A plant vendor managing supply chain and delivery
- **Felicity**: A gardening expert assisting customer support
- **Zach**: An amateur gardener who uses his plants for cooking
- **Nia**: A remote-working consultant seeking a visually appealing backdrop
- **Reena**: A flower lover who wants weekly arrangements

Creating personas puts you in the users’ shoes and helps in designing more user-centered products.

## 🧪 I.N.V.E.S.T. Criteria for User Stories

Each user story should meet six criteria, represented by the acronym **INVEST**:

| Letter | Meaning       | Description                                                                 |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I**  | Independent     | The story should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.     |
| **N**  | Negotiable      | The story should allow room for discussion and improvement.                |
| **V**  | Valuable        | The outcome should deliver clear value to the user or business.            |
| **E**  | Estimable       | The team should be able to estimate the effort required.                   |
| **S**  | Small           | It should fit within a single Sprint; otherwise, break it down.            |
| **T**  | Testable        | Acceptance criteria should be clear so it can be tested when completed.    |

> 📌 While the **Product Owner** writes the user stories, the **team** must review and provide feedback to ensure clarity and INVEST compliance before development starts.

### 📝 User Story (Live Plant Delivery Epic):

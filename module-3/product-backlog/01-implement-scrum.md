## Wrapping Up the Scrum Introduction

Hi there!

In the previous section, we introduced you to **Scrum**. We explored the **Scrum values** and explained the **essential roles** that every Scrum Team needs. In this video, we'll complete our overview of Scrum by diving deep into the **setup and day-to-day execution** of a Scrum Team.

We'll go **beyond the official Scrum Guide** and share some of the most popular tools, methods, tips, and tricks used in real-world Scrum teams.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll cover:

- **Product Backlog Management**  
  You'll learn how to manage the **Product Backlog**, which contains all the features, requirements, and tasks needed to achieve the project's goals.

- **Estimation Techniques**  
  We'll cover one of the trickiest parts of Scrum: **estimation**. Youâ€™ll understand what **T-shirt sizing** and **story points** mean in the context of Scrum, through a technique called **relative effort estimation**.

- **The Five Scrum Events**  
  Weâ€™ll walk through each of the five key Scrum events:
  1. **Sprint**
  2. **Sprint Planning**
  3. **Daily Scrum**
  4. **Sprint Review**
  5. **Sprint Retrospective**

- **Tracking Progress**  
  You'll learn what **velocity** means and how to use tools like **burndown charts** to monitor your teamâ€™s progress effectively.

- **Useful Tools for Scrum Teams**  
  We'll also introduce you to tools that help keep your workflow organized and transparent:
  - Google Docs
  - JIRA
  - Asana
  - Trello
  - Kanban Boards

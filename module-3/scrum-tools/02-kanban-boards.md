# Using Kanban and Scrum Boards in Scrum

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of visualizing progress using **burndown charts**. In this video, we explore another essential visual tool used by Scrum teams: the **Kanban board** — often also referred to as a **Scrum board**.

> While "Kanban board" and "Scrum board" have minor differences, they are often used interchangeably in practice.

## What Are Kanban or Scrum Boards?

Although the **Scrum Guide** does not define a Scrum board explicitly, many Scrum tools on the market offer enhanced Kanban boards tailored for Scrum. These tools help Scrum Teams visualize and track progress during a Sprint.

### Key Features:
1. **Visualization**
2. **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits**
3. **Flow of Work**

---

## 1. Visualization

Kanban and Scrum boards allow teams to see the status of work at a glance.

- You can **point to work items** directly for discussion.
- Use **color-coded cards, icons, and labels** for clarity.
- Helps identify **challenges** and bottlenecks in the workflow.

Without this kind of visibility, it’s harder to identify areas for **improvement**.

## 2. Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits

> "There's no such thing as multitasking" — especially in Scrum.

- WIP limits **restrict the number of active tasks** in a given column (e.g., “Doing”).
- Encourages **focus**—a core Scrum value.
- Helps avoid **context switching** and **task overload**.
- Teams set their own WIP limits based on their unique context.

Boards make it visually obvious when a WIP limit is exceeded.

## 3. Flow of Work

Kanban boards improve visibility into the **movement of tasks** through stages of development:

Typical stages:
- **To Do**
- **Doing**
- **Done**

This visual flow helps teams track progress and celebrate completion. Moving tasks is often done during the **Daily Scrum**, but it can happen anytime.

---

## Example: Virtual Verde Team

- Leo, a team member, finishes his task:  
  _"Finalize contracts with the top three plant vendors."_
- He moves the card from **Doing → Done** on the Kanban board.
- If it’s his last task for the Sprint, he checks in with the team to **help others**.

---

## Summary

**Kanban/Scrum boards** are invaluable tools that help Scrum Teams:

✅ Visualize progress  
✅ Limit and manage work-in-progress  
✅ Improve the flow of work  
✅ Stay aligned and collaborative  

They promote Scrum values like **focus**, **transparency**, and **collaboration**.

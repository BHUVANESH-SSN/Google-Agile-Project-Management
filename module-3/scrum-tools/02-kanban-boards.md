# Sprint Retrospective in Scrum

If you've been following this program, you've already learned a lot about **retrospectives**, an essential part of project management—no matter the methodology you follow. In this section, we'll focus on the **fifth and final Scrum event: the Sprint Retrospective**.

## What is the Sprint Retrospective?

The **Sprint Retrospective** is a dedicated meeting—up to **three hours long**—held at the end of each Sprint. Its goal is for the **Scrum Team** to:

- Reflect on how the last Sprint went.
- Identify what went well and what didn’t.
- Decide what improvements can be made for the next Sprint.

### Key Reflection Areas:

- **People** – Collaboration and communication.
- **Processes** – Efficiency and workflow.
- **Tools** – Technology and systems in use.

**Sample Questions to Discuss:**
- What improvements were introduced in the last Sprint?
- Were they effective or not? Why?
- What should we try in the next Sprint?
- What unexpected issues did we face?
- What slowed us down?

## Best Practices for Effective Retrospectives

### 1. Foster a Blameless Environment
- Demonstrate the **Scrum value of respect**.
- Create a **safe space** where team members feel comfortable sharing feedback without fear of blame or consequences.
- If needed, allow **anonymous or private feedback**.

### 2. Encourage Participation
- Retrospectives only work if **everyone contributes**.
- Use prompting questions like:
  - "What is one thing we could try next Sprint?"
  - "Where did we encounter delays?"
  - "What happened that we didn’t anticipate?"

**Example:**  
> My team recently realized that dependencies on external stakeholders were slowing us down. In the retrospective, we agreed to improve communication channels to increase visibility of our priorities.

### 3. Balance Positives and Negatives
- Don’t only focus on what went wrong.
- Ask:  
  - "Where did we succeed?"
  - "What should we continue doing?"

This builds **team morale** and helps replicate successful outcomes.

### 4. Take Action
- Teams may stop engaging if they feel feedback leads nowhere.
- Always **act on feedback**.
- Turn what worked into **standard habits** or **team norms**.

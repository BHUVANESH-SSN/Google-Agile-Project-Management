# üìä Burndown Charts & Velocity in Scrum

In this lesson, we explore two powerful tools used by Scrum Teams to manage their work:

- **Burndown Charts**
- **Velocity**

These tools allow teams to track progress during a Sprint and across the entire Product Backlog.

---

## üî• What is a Burndown Chart?

A **burndown chart** tracks:
- **Time** (usually in days) on the x-axis
- **Work remaining** (in points or effort) on the y-axis

### üéØ Purpose:
- Keep the team **aware of progress** against Sprint goals.
- Help **visualize completion trends** over time.
- Provide data for **inspect-and-adapt** discussions.

---

## üìà Example: Burndown Chart in Action

- **Sprint Length:** 4 weeks = 20 business days
- **Sprint Backlog Effort:** 200 points
- **Expected Burn:** 10 points per day (200 √∑ 20)

### Burndown Data:

| Day | Points Completed | Status |
|-----|------------------|--------|
| 5   | 22               | On track |
| 10  | 45               | Behind (should be ~100) |
| 15  | 140              | Recovered |
| 20  | 188              | Nearly done |

> üìå Tip: If your team uses T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L), map them to numbers like: XS = 1, S = 2, M = 5, L = 8, etc.

## üìâ What is Velocity?

**Velocity** is the average number of story points a team completes in a Sprint.

### üß† Key Points:
- Calculated over **multiple recent Sprints** (usually 3+).
- Used in **Sprint Planning** to determine how much work can be committed.
- **Not** a measure of team quality or speed.
- Each team has a **unique velocity** due to their sizing calibration.

> üß™ Example:
> - Team A (3 people): 1-week Sprint, burns 70 points ‚Üí Velocity = 70
> - Team B (5 people): 2-week Sprint, burns 120 points ‚Üí Velocity = 120  
> - No team is better; they are just different.

---

## üîì Why Velocity Matters

Once your team reaches a **stable velocity**, you can confidently estimate:

- **How long it will take** to complete the Product Backlog
- **How much will be delivered** by a specific date

### üì¶ Example:

- **Average Velocity:** 200 points/month
- **Backlog Size:** 1500 points
- **Estimated Time to Complete:** 1500 √∑ 200 = ~7.5 Sprints (~7‚Äì8 months)

> üí° Want to know what's ready by Jan 1st (5 months away)?  
> Multiply 200 √ó 5 = 1000 ‚Üí Plan to deliver the top 1000 points from the Backlog.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- It‚Äôs **normal** for velocity to fluctuate early in a project.
- Velocity **stabilizes** as the team builds rhythm and gains estimation accuracy.
- Use **burndown charts + velocity** together for strong execution predictability.
- These metrics empower teams to:
  - Add/remove resources
  - Reprioritize features
  - Set realistic stakeholder expectations

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept         | Definition |
|----------------|------------|
| **Burndown Chart** | Visual tool showing work completed vs. remaining over time |
| **Velocity**         | Average number of story points completed per Sprint |
| **Stable Velocity**  | Enables accurate forecasting and planning |

Using these tools well makes your Scrum Team more predictable, transparent, and responsive.

## âœ… The 4 Agile Values

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
   > People are more important than rigid systems. Great collaboration drives great results.

2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
   > Deliver usable software first. Documentation is useful but shouldnâ€™t delay working solutions.

3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
   > Involve customers frequently instead of only relying on fixed contracts.

4. **Responding to change** over following a plan  
   > Plans are useful, but being flexible and adapting quickly to change is more valuable.

## ðŸ§­ The 12 Agile Principles

1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery**  
   Deliver valuable software as early and as often as possible.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**  
   Agile embraces change to improve customer outcomes.

3. **Deliver working software frequently**  
   Ship working software in short cycles (weekly or monthly).

4. **Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers**  
   Communication ensures mutual understanding and faster solutions.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals**  
   Trust your team. Give them the environment and support they need.

6. **Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication**  
   Clear and quick communication reduces misunderstandings.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**  
   Functioning products matter more than status updates.

   Teams should maintain a steady pace indefinitely (avoid burnout).

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design**  
   Clean, maintainable code leads to lasting products.

10. **Simplicityâ€”the art of maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€”is essential**  
    Focus on what's truly needed. Avoid overengineering.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**  
    Trust teams to innovate and solve problems.

    Hold retrospectives to learn and improve constantly.

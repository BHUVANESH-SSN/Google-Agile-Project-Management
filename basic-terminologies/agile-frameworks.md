- **Pair Programming** – Two developers work together at one workstation
- **Continuous Integration** – Code is integrated and tested frequently
- **Refactoring** – Continuously improve code structure
- **Small Releases** – Deliver software frequently
- **Coding Standards** – Maintain uniform coding style
- **Sustainable Pace** – Avoid burnout; work at a steady speed
- **Customer On-Site** – Customer is available for feedback and decisions

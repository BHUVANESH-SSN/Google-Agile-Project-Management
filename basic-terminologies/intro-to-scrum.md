# Scrum Methodology

## What is Scrum?

- Scrum is **not** an acronym.
- The term comes from **rugby**, where players work closely as a unit to push forward—an analogy for close-knit, collaborative teams.
- Scrum is the most widely-used Agile framework, especially in **software** but also adaptable across industries.

## Key Characteristics of Scrum

- **Iterative and Incremental** delivery of work.
- Emphasizes **team collaboration**, **flexibility**, and **continuous improvement**.
- Work is delivered in **short cycles** called **Sprints**.
- Teams meet **daily** to discuss progress and resolve issues.

## Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog**:  
  A prioritized list of features, fixes, or tasks maintained and updated throughout the project.
  
- **Sprint**:  
  A time-boxed development cycle, usually **1–4 weeks** (commonly 2 weeks).
  
- **Daily Scrum (Stand-Up)**:  
  A short (≤15 minutes) daily meeting where the team reviews progress and addresses blockers.

## Scrum Roles

- **Scrum Master**:  
  - Ensures the team follows Agile values and Scrum practices.  
  - Shields the team from distractions.  
  - Acts as a facilitator and coach.

- **Product Owner**:  
  - Owns and prioritizes the **Product Backlog**.  
  - Maximizes product value.  
  - Represents the stakeholders' voice.

  - Responsible for delivering working increments each Sprint.

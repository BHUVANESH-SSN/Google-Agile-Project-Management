# Addressing Change Challenges in Agile Teams

As the **Project Manager** or **Scrum Master**, it's your responsibility to help teams improve how they work and coach them on effectively adopting Scrum practices. To do this, you need to **anticipate and understand common challenges** before they arise.

Remember the four **Agile principle themes**:
1. Value delivery
2. Business collaboration
3. Team dynamics
4. Culture and retrospectives

In this guide, we’ll focus on the **first three** themes.

## 🧩 1. Challenges with Value Delivery

**Value delivery** is about delivering **working solutions frequently**.

### Signs of Value Delivery Issues:
- Missed delivery dates
- Slower-than-usual task completion
- Team burnout and exhaustion
- Too many items in progress (WIP), leading to nothing getting done

### Solutions:
- **More frequent demos** to review the working product and stay aligned with the value roadmap
- Use **retrospectives** to uncover blockers like dependencies or communication gaps
- Clarify the **Definition of Done** with the entire team
- Focus on **fewer user stories per Sprint** to maintain flow and delivery

> ⚠️ Tip: It’s better to deliver **a few fully completed Backlog items** in one Sprint than start too many and delay value delivery.

## 🤝 2. Challenges with Business Collaboration

**Business collaboration** ensures developers and business people align on delivering the **right product**.

### Common Signs:
- Overwhelming critical feedback or excessive change requests from stakeholders
- Developers reluctant to demo due to fear of criticism
- “Us vs. them” mentality developing between devs and business teams

### Solutions:
- Run **frequent demos** to collect steady, actionable feedback
- Conduct a **Solution Design Sprint**:
  - A full Sprint focused solely on collaboration between the business and delivery teams
- Limit **Backlog changes to between Sprints** to reduce interruptions and stress
- Direct feedback requests (e.g., from directors) through the **Scrum Master**, not directly to engineers

> 🧠 Real-world example: To avoid disruptions, a team asked their Engineering Director to route requests through the Scrum Master, allowing better planning and team focus.

## 👥 3. Challenges with Team Dynamics & Culture

Teams are made up of people—each with their own working style and communication preferences.

### Warning Signs:
- Low team morale (grumpiness, irritability)
- Frequent unresolved conflict
- **No conflict at all** (can indicate fear of speaking up)

> 🔍 Remember: A lack of disagreement can signal a **psychologically unsafe environment** where people don’t feel comfortable sharing honest feedback.

### Solutions:
- Run **team brainstorm sessions** on how to improve collaboration
  - Exercise: Share stories of the *best* and *worst* teams each member has been on
  - Create a team "Do’s and Don’ts" list based on shared stories
- Change up workflows or meeting styles
- Pair team members on difficult tasks
- Attend training or watch videos together on **team dynamics**
- Use creative retrospective formats like:

### 🧠 Six Hats Thinking Technique:
- Each team member wears a “hat” with a unique perspective:
  - Positives
  - Negatives
  - Emotions
  - Data
  - Creative ideas
  - Processes
- This encourages **balanced reflection** and open discussion during retrospectives

## ✅ Summary

Agile transformation comes with challenges—especially in areas of:

1. **Value delivery**  
2. **Business collaboration**  
3. **Team dynamics and culture**

As a Scrum Master or Agile PM:
- Watch for early warning signs.
- Facilitate communication and collaboration.
- Build psychological safety.
- Maintain team focus.
- Always encourage reflection and learning.

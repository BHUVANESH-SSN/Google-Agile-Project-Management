## Maximizing Value Through Agile and Scrum

Hi again!

Previously, you learned how to effectively implement Scrum to help your team deliver amazing products. In this section, we’ll explore the **result of a project**—the **end product**—and the **value** it brings to users and customers.

---

### 🔍 What Is Value in Project Management?

- **Value** is the benefit the **end product** provides to the **user** or **customer**.
- It can take many forms:
  - 💵 Financial benefits
  - 📈 User growth and engagement
  - ✅ Compliance adherence

> Different customers define value differently based on their expectations of the product.

---

### 🧭 Agile Principle: Deliver Value Early & Often

> *“The number one Agile principle is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”*

- Replace "software" with **product** or **solution** in non-software contexts.
- Agile emerged to **shift focus from process** to **product usefulness**.

---

### 🎯 Value-Driven Delivery

**Definition**: Focusing on building and delivering **high-value products**.

❗ Just delivering something doesn’t mean it's valuable.

Agile addresses the old problem of teams focusing too much on process, and not enough on **evaluating product value until it's too late**.

---

### ✅ How to Ensure Value-Driven Delivery

Use the three-step mantra:

1. **Build the Right Thing**
2. **Build the Thing Right**
3. **Run It Right**

Let’s break these down:

---

### 1️⃣ Build the Right Thing

- Understand what the customer *really* wants.
- Ask:
  - Do they want a website? Or do they want to boost customer acquisition?
  - Do they want more brand visibility?

> 🎯 Have solution-oriented conversations to uncover true goals.

---

### 2️⃣ Build the Thing Right

- Only build **requested or approved features**.
- Avoid "feature creep"—extra features add complexity but not always value.
- Benefits:
  - Faster delivery
  - Fewer bugs
  - Higher value

---

### 3️⃣ Run It Right

Think through **user interaction** after delivery:

- How will users get support?
- How is the product maintained?
- How do you continue adding value?

> This ensures **sustained value** after initial delivery.

### 🚀 Summary

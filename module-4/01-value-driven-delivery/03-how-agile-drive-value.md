## Thoughts on Agile

**My favorite thing about Agile** has got to be the *flexibility*.

When you're making most of the decisions at the beginning—when you know the least—not all those decisions might be right. Some will, but probably all of them won’t be.

With **Agile**, it’s a **framework** and a **mindset** that is open to that change—**that embraces it**, **welcomes it** as you learn more.

Agile gives you built-in opportunities to make changes.

## Incremental Delivery

You're delivering little bits over the course of a long period of time.

To contrast that, you could think of **Waterfall**—that’s when you deliver everything at once to the customer at the end.

In a **Waterfall project**, you have to wait and wait and wait until the very end to get everything.  
Perhaps you're waiting **days, months, or years**, and you **cannot extract any value** out of it until the very end—until the product is delivered.

## When Waterfall Makes Sense

> "I think that makes sense for a house."  
> "I think that makes sense for a car."

You can't give someone parts of a car and have them start getting value out of it, because a car has certain **safety requirements**.

## Agile Enables Early Value

For things that take longer to figure out, for more challenging design issues, **you don’t have to sacrifice the entire project for that one last bit**.

If you built **90% of the project** and you can ship it—**go ahead**.

Agile lets you **extract that value**.  
That way, people can use that 90% while you’re trying to figure out that last ten.

And hopefully, you have an ecosystem where it's okay to **deploy** or **release** that last 10% down the line.

## Embracing Change

> "Change is never free."

You've already communicated plans, made estimates, and you have work in progress.  
If you're going to **change that**, you're going to lose **a little bit**.

The question is:  
**Is that change within your threshold or your budget** to be able to adapt—to get it right or get it better?

It’s not always about it being perfect.  
**It’s about it being good.**

# Value Roadmap - Transcript Summary

Hello again. In the last video, you learned about **value-driven delivery**, where the team focuses on delivering a product that has **maximum value for its customers**.

## What is a Value Roadmap?

A **value roadmap** is an Agile way of mapping out the **timelines** and **requirements** for the product development process. It applies to all types of businesses.

It acts as a **guide** that demonstrates:
- Where to go
- How to get there
- What to accomplish along the way to maximize value

> As the team follows their roadmap, they gather input from customers and stakeholders and apply their findings to each iteration of the product.

Creating a roadmap:
- Helps the team explain the **vision** of the product
- Identifies **important milestones**

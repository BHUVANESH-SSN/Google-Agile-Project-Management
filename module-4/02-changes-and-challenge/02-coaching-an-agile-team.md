# Your Role as a Coach (Scrum Master / Agile Project Manager)

As the project manager or Scrum Master, you're in the position to help the team improve. In other words, you're the designated **Agile coach**. Your job is to help the team recognize areas for improvement and implement effective solutions.

In this guide, we’ll break down your coaching role into **three key steps**, similar to how you might approach being a coach for a sports team:

---

## 🧠 1. Design the Plays *with* the Team

- As the Scrum Master, you **own the playbook**, but it should be **co-created with the whole team**.
- The playbook should include:
  - How the team conducts **Sprint Reviews**
  - How the team works **day-to-day**
  - How the team **shares plans with stakeholders**
- When changes are needed:
  - Involve the entire team in the decision-making.
  - Think through everyone’s role and how the workflow is affected.
  - Run sessions to discuss what’s working and what’s not.

> **Example**: I once facilitated a brainstorm session with my team using sticky notes to identify pain points in our process. We prioritized them and implemented the top ideas.

---

## 🗣️ 2. Provide Feedback

- Give **early and continuous feedback** to both team members and stakeholders.
- Like a coach on the sidelines, offer real-time guidance and direction.
- Also, take a **big-picture view**, just like a coach reviewing a game video:
  - Identify patterns for improvement.
  - Reinforce plays that work really well.

> Feedback isn’t just about fixing problems — it’s also about **recognizing what works and encouraging the team to do more of it**.

---

## 🎉 3. Celebrate and Learn

- Acknowledge and celebrate:
  - A job well done
  - A happy customer
  - A successful product/solution launch
- When the team "loses" (e.g., fails to meet a requirement):
  - Use it as **critical learning data**.
  - Maintain a **positive mindset** even in disappointment.

> *"I have not failed—I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."*  
> — **Thomas Edison**

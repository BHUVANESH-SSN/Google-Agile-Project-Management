## Example Scenario: Virtual Verde Project

> The Product Owner tells the Development Team to work in this order:  
> `1. Flower arrangements → 2. Potted succulents → 3. Large potted plants → 4. Herb gardens`

However, the Development Team identifies that **herb gardens**, previously assumed to be difficult (due to food regulation), are actually **easier** to deliver since the vendor already has them in stock.

A good Product Owner:
- **Listens to the Development Team**
- **Reprioritizes the backlog**
- **Focuses on delivering customer value faster**

This shows the importance of being **flexible** and **collaborative**.

## Recap

A Product Owner:
- Is the **voice of the customer**
- Owns and manages the **Product Backlog**
- Must be **customer-focused, decisive, flexible, optimistic, available**, and **collaborative**

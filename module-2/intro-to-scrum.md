## 🔍 What is Scrum?

**Scrum** is a framework defined by the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/) used to **develop, deliver, and sustain complex products**.

- It is **iterative** (repeating processes in timeboxed Sprints).
- It is **incremental** (delivering work in smaller usable parts).
- It is built on **empiricism**: the idea that knowledge comes from lived experience.

## ⚙️ Empiricism and the Three Pillars of Scrum

Scrum is founded on **empirical process control theory**, which emphasizes learning through experience and making decisions based on what is known.

### 🏛️ The Three Pillars of Scrum

| Pillar        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Important aspects of work are visible to those responsible for outcomes. Promotes trust, reduces miscommunication, and helps identify problems early. |
| **Inspection**   | Frequent checks on progress to detect undesirable variances. Promotes learning and course correction during the project. |
| **Adaptation**   | Making changes to process, product, or behavior based on inspection. Helps avoid recurring mistakes and enables continuous improvement. |

> 📝 Example: After inspecting Sprint progress, the team adapts by modifying its approach or tools.

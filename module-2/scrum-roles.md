# 📘 Scrum Team Overview

## 🎯 Introduction to Scrum Roles

Think of a **Scrum Team** like a **sports team** — each position (like a striker, goalkeeper, or defender) has a distinct role, but they all aim to win the game together.

In Scrum (inspired by rugby), each role contributes uniquely to achieving a shared objective — delivering valuable products through collaboration.

## 🌟 Mission and Vision in Scrum

- **Agile Principle**: *"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."*
- A **Mission** is a constant motivational statement that guides the team.
- A **Product Vision** defines what success looks like — what the product will achieve when complete.

### 🪴 Example – *Virtual Verde* (by Office Green):
- **Mission**: *"Virtual Verde improves users' health and happiness by bringing their at-home workspace to life."*
- **Product Vision**: *"Virtual Verde is a living marketplace that transforms the home office."*

These are designed to inspire and align the team around meaningful work.

## 👥 Scrum Team Composition

Scrum Teams consist of **three core roles**:

| Role            | Focus Area                            | Primary Responsibility                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Owner   | **What** the team builds               | Ensure the team is building the right product and maximize value. |
| Development Team| **How** the product is built           | Create the working product (code, systems, designs).       |
| Scrum Master    | **When** value is delivered            | Facilitate delivery, unblock issues, and coach the team.   |

### 🎯 Role Summaries

- **Product Owner**: Owns the product backlog, aligns stakeholders, prioritizes features, and ensures clarity of the "why".
- **Development Team**: Delivers functional product increments, maintains quality, and self-manages their work.
- **Scrum Master**: Supports the team by removing blockers, ensuring Scrum best practices, and enabling continuous improvement.

> 🧠 Think of it like this:
> - Product Owner: **Build the right thing**  
> - Development Team: **Build the thing right**  
> - Scrum Master: **Build the thing fast**

## 🤝 Role Collaboration

Although each role has defined responsibilities:

- Everyone collaborates.
- Developers may suggest *what* to build or *when* to release.
- Product Owners may give input on *how* to build features.

## 💡 Characteristics of Scrum Teams

### 1. **Cross-Functional**

- Team includes all skills necessary to deliver value.
- Example roles: Developer, QA engineer, Marketing specialist, Logistics expert.
- Like a soccer team, everyone plays a unique position but works toward the same goal.

### 2. **Self-Organizing**

- Teams decide how best to accomplish work without being directed.
- Encouraged by Scrum’s core values: **Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness, Respect**.

> 📌 Note: Scrum Teams may still have a **manager outside the Scrum Team** for strategic direction and career development — but they must **not interfere** with the team’s self-organization.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Scrum Teams are:
  - **Cross-functional**: All necessary skills are within the team.
  - **Self-organizing**: Teams choose how to work effectively.
- **Mission and Vision** help motivate and align team efforts.
- Defined roles (PO, Dev Team, SM) ensure clarity, but flexibility in collaboration is encouraged.

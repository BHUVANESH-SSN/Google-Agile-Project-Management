# The Development Team in Scrum

Hi again. In the previous video, we discussed the role of the **Product Owner** on the Scrum Team.

In this video, we'll discuss the **Development Team** within a Scrum Team.

## Who Are the Development Team?

The Development Team is made up of the people who do the work to build the product.

- The size of the team typically ranges from **three to nine people**.
- This ensures the team is:
  - Small enough to remain **nimble**
  - Large enough to complete **significant work within each Sprint**

> ⚖️ Getting the team size just right is important.

- **Smaller teams** may lack diversity in skills and ideas.
- **Larger teams** may face challenges with too many opinions and communication streams.

## Characteristics of a Development Team

- **Cross-functional**: The team should have all the skills needed to build the product **in-house**.
- **Self-organizing**: The team owns their own processes and structures.
  - They **cannot rely** on others to organize them.
- **Collaborative**: They work as a **unit**, not as individuals.
- **Customer-oriented**: They focus on the **end user** when building products.

## Co-located vs. Virtual Teams

- **Co-located teams** (working in the same physical space) often:
  - Deliver higher-quality work
  - Improve more quickly
- **Virtual teams** are more common and also viable:
  - Tools like **Zoom** or **Skype** allow real-time collaboration

> ✅ Use whichever method works best for your team.

### Example: Virtual Verde Team

- A plant vendor has quality issues during a holiday rush.
- The **quality assurance specialist** must fly across the country to help.
  - If the team is **co-located**, they can quickly:
    - Huddle
    - Brainstorm
    - Rearrange work to avoid missing Sprint goals
  - If the team is **remote**:
    - They need to coordinate over phone/email
    - May face **delays** due to time zones or scheduling

## Scrum Roles Recap

- **Product Owner**: Responsible for meeting customer needs → _"Building the right thing"_
- **Development Team**: Creates the product → _"Building the thing right"_
- **Scrum Master**: Improves efficiency → _"Building the thing fast"_

All roles are equally important and **work together** to create value for users and customers.

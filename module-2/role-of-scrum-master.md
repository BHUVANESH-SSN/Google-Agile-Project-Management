# 👨‍🏫 Scrum Master Role Explained

## 🧩 What Is a Scrum Master?

A **Scrum Master** promotes and supports the use of Scrum by helping everyone understand **Scrum practices, rules, and values**.

> 🔑 Think of the Scrum Master as the person responsible for **helping the team be their best** — by removing obstacles, coaching on Agile principles, and enabling smooth collaboration.

## 🛠 Responsibilities of a Scrum Master

- **Coach the team** on Agile and Scrum rules, values, and practices.
- **Facilitate Scrum events**, like:
  - Daily Scrum
  - Sprint Planning
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Remove blockers** that hinder progress (e.g., missing information, delayed vendor input).
- **Protect the team** from external disruptions or unhelpful interference.
- **Help manage the Product Backlog** effectively with the Product Owner.

### 📦 Example Scenario: Virtual Verde
Virtual Verde is receiving recurring errors in the shopping cart feature. The Scrum Master identifies the pattern and works with the team to implement better testing or review processes — rather than treating each bug in isolation.
